Scrabble Rules Overview:

Objective:
  - The goal of Scrabble is to score the most points by making words using letter tiles.

Game Setup:
  - Each player draws 7 letter tiles from the tile bag to form their starting hand.
  - The board consists of a 15x15 grid of squares, some of which have special scoring multipliers.

Playing the Game:

Forming Words: 
  - On each turn, a player forms a word using their tiles and places them on the board.
  - The first word must be placed such that one of its tiles is on the center square.
  - Subsequent words must connect to or extend words already on the board.

Valid Moves:
  - Words can be formed horizontally (left to right) or vertically (top to bottom).
  - All words formed (including new words created by adding to existing words) must be valid words 
    according to the dictionary.

Scoring Points:
  - Each letter tile has a point value.
  - Points for a word are calculated by summing the point values of its tiles.
  - Special board squares multiply the points:
     - Double Letter Score (DL): Doubles the point value of the tile placed on it.
     - Triple Letter Score (TL): Triples the point value of the tile placed on it.
     - Double Word Score (DW): Doubles the total point value of the word.
     - Triple Word Score (TW): Triples the total point value of the word.

End of Turn:
  - After placing tiles and calculating the score, the player draws new tiles from the bag to 
    replenish their hand to 7 tiles and play goes to the other player.

Game End:
  - The game ends when all tiles have been drawn and one player uses their last tile, or when 
     no more valid moves can be made.
  - Final scores are counted, and the player with the highest score wins.
