Hard to test gui functionality

loop() was broken into several pieces so it may help to test individual functions
modify init_vars function to better enable testing (e.g. inputting a gameboard or scores)
maybe can hard-code test boards to test specific things. Are we allowed to do this/does it count as lines of code?

things to test:
GUI:
do documentation for .mli file
draw tiles
-does it pick properly?
-what if there are no tiles to draw
-does it distinguish between all tiles
-what if the bag already has too many tiles

enter cell
-what things can we enter?
-what happens if we try to enter in strange cells?
-what happens if we enter in already entered cell?

end game 
-*what if there are no moves left?
-does it calculate points correctly?

try guess
-does it really reset board if guess is invalid?
-does it really take any valid guess?

SCRABBL:
valid-word
-be very thorough

eval_guess
-check all possibilities
-what if it's a valid word but not all in a line?
-what if it's multiple valid words?
-what if it's extending a previous word?
-what if it's extending words horizontally and vertically?
-does it give the right point value?
-does it correctly give point values for a word on every type of multiplier?
-does it give point values to the right player?
-does it properly apply multipliers for extended words
-also fix documentation for this fn

point_val
-check point vals of every single letter hehe

GAMEBOARD:
yeah

hi :)
